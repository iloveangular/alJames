                                    A Trademark is a symbol, phrase, design or word that helps distinguish one manufacturer of goods
                                    from
                                    another. It is a key identifier of a company used all over the world. An example of a famous
                                    trademark
                                    is
                                    Apple, which is represented by a bitten apple. This mark has no writing, so the image itself is
                                    the key
                                    identifier for Apple. Similarly, a service mark follows the same features but is different
                                    because it is
                                    used to identify a service. An example of a well-known service mark is McDonald's whose mark is
                                    a golden
                                    'M'
                                    which is globally recognized by all ages since 1955.
                                    Additionally, in certain circumstances, trade/service marks can also involve colours, music, and
                                    smell.
                                    For
                                    example, Coca-Cola is well known for its red and white colour combination, and Nokia is known
                                    for its
                                    unique
                                    ringtone.</p><b>Property and Intellectual Property</b>
                                    <p>
                                        'Intellectual property,' however, has no physical embodiment that one can see, touch or feel such
                                        as
                                        literature and music. Trade names, artistic designs and digital programming are also part of the
                                        intellectual property band. Like physical property, the intellectual property can be owned,
                                        purchased,
                                        sold,
                                        transferred, and/or licensed. Systems of ownership of intellectual property are relatively new
                                        historically.</p><b>Trademark Rights</b>
                                    <p>
                                        Trademarks adopt rights in two ways: 1) by registration, and 2) by using the mark first. Both
                                        ways can
                                        be
                                        protected. By registering, you will gain many advantages from the federal law, including the use
                                        of the
                                        ®
                                        symbol on your trademark. You will also have the ability to show others of your ownership to the
                                        brand,
                                        making it less likely for others to consume. Under common law, being the first to use a specific
                                        trademark
                                        also comes with certain rights that may stop others from using your mark. However, this can be
                                        risky
                                        because
                                        it does not come with as many benefits as a registered trademark would.</p>
                                    <p><b>TIP</b></p>
                                    <p>
                                        The more unique a trademark is, the less chance it has for it to be duplicated, which means more
                                        protection.
                                        It is also good to know that successful marks are normally those that have no relation to the
                                        service or
                                        goods.</p><b>Trademark Registration</b>
                                    <p>
                                        Before adopting a new mark, it is advisable to have a search conducted and evaluated by a
                                        qualified
                                        attorney. Someone else may already have rights to virtually the same mark, and it is better to
                                        know
                                        about
                                        that or other potentially conflicting marks before you have made an investment in your new mark.
                                        Lack of
                                        knowledge is normally not a defense to trademark infringement. The extent of searching that is
                                        warranted
                                        depends on the nature of the mark, the goods or services for which it is to be used, and the
                                        countries
                                        in
                                        which the mark is intended to be used. Basic searches typically focus on trademark registration
                                        databases.
                                        Usually, an application to register a trademark is made to the national trademark office in the
                                        country
                                        or
                                        region where the applicant wishes to protect the mark. The application will usually include the
                                        name and
                                        address of the applicant, a representation of the mark, a listing of the goods or services that
                                        are
                                        desired
                                        to be covered by the registration, and the official filing fee. In some jurisdictions, it may
                                        also be
                                        necessary to file specimens showing how the mark is used. However, most countries do not require
                                        a mark
                                        to
                                        be used before it is registered.</p><b>Trademark Symbols</b>
                                    <p>
                                        Trademarks are often used with designations or symbols, i.e. ®, also known as Reg., TM, and SM.
                                        These
                                        symbols work as trademark identifiers classifying whether or not a trademark is registered.
                                        Unregistered
                                        Trademarks use the symbols TM and SM to notify competitors and potential customers of their plan
                                        to
                                        become
                                        legal and are used to discourage others from using them. Each designation is used for a
                                        different
                                        purpose;
                                        SM is used for a service mark, whereas TM is used for a trademark. The ® symbol refers to a
                                        registered
                                        trademark. This small but powerful symbol will allow the owner to claim against infringement if
                                        an issue
                                        occurs. It is always a good idea to register your trademark to have secure benefits.
                                        The protection of your trademark will depend on your country of registration which has its ups
                                        and
                                        downs.
                                        Not all regional offices will give out the same benefits, so choose your country wisely so that
                                        you
                                        receive
                                        the all the information and protection you need.
                                        Your mark should represent your business in a creative yet effective way, making sure the
                                        meaning
                                        explains
                                        your business accurately. It is only when your mark is used consistently, i.e same font type and
                                        colour,
                                        that your mark becomes respected and desired.</p></div>

                                        unauthorized users. Using a trademark without registration will not come with many benefits. The
                                        main
                                        concern is that there will always be a high risk of losing it at a later stage as others would
                                        see
                                        it as
                                        available and register it. By registering your trademark, you will hold all the rights as well
                                        as
                                        the
                                        ability to take legal action against anyone who uses it unlawfully. If, however, you do not
                                        decide
                                        to
                                        register your trademark, you will risk your chances of it being registered by someone else.</p>

                                        Still not convinced to perform a Trademark search? You will be shocked to find out that not all trademark authorities go through the process of investigating whether or not a trademark already exists. This can accumulate chaos as authorities from different parts of the world may register the same mark at different times creating a legal mess. That's why it should be your priority to monitor similar or identical registered trademarks. It is only by monitoring that you can identify whether or not legal action should be imposed.</p>
